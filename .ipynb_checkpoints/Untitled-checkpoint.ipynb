    "# RxJava\n",
    "## Intro - \n",
    "- RxJava is a specific implementation of reactive programming for Java and Android that is influenced by functional programming.\n",
    "- Favors functional composition, avoidance of global state and side-effects and using streams to program asynchronously and event based\n",
    "- **Reactive programming** is related to reacting to changes and can be done imperatively or functionally like callbacks\n",
    "- RxJava is not functional reactive programming\n",
    "- All programs ultimately end up being reactive when it hits harware\n",
    "- Recommended books [Java Concurrency in Practice](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Concurrency-Practice-Brian-Goetz/dp/0321349601), [Concurrent Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Concurrent-Programming-Java%C2%99-Principles-Pattern/dp/0201310090) and **Mechanical sympathy\n",

    "### Push vs Pull - \n",
    "- Being reactive means supporting push so that `Observable` and `Observer` support the events being pushed at it\n",
    "- The `Observable` and `Observer` are connected via subscription\n",
    "- The `Observable` represents a stream of data and can be subscribed to by the `Observer`    \n",
    "- Once `Observer` subscribes, three types of events can be pushed to it\n",
    " - Data via `onNext()` function\n",
    " - Error view `onError`\n",
    " - Stream completion via `onComplete()`    \n"
